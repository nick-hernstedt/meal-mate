- AS two people are hungry and trying to come to a decision where to eat. I WANT an easy way to see local restaurants and compare with each other which one we like. SO THAT we can decide on a restaurant.
- GIVEN a location input
- WHEN I enter a location THEN I am given 20 restaurants inside that radius.

- WHEN a match is made THEN we go to eat there.
